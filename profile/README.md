Communal Helper Organization
==========================
This is a [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) community modding organization. 

All projects in this organization are open to bug reports, feature requests, and contributions.

## Communal Helper
[Communal Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/CommunalHelper) is a general-purpose code mod designed for open-source community development.

## Ahorn2Lönn
To encourage the adoption of [Lönn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn), we are working to port helper plugins for legacy mods. Most plugins will be included with their helpers, but we are using the [Ahorn2Lönn](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/Ahorn2Loenn) project for helpers we don't have edit access to. 

Let us know if you are interested in helping! 

## Legacy Helper Project
There are many code mods (also known as **helpers**) that are no longer actively maintained, which can break maps or code relying on them as [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/) changes or new helpers break compatibility. The goal of this project is to make those helpers open source and community-maintained.

If you want to view documentation, submit a bug report, request a feature, or make a contribution, go to the individual page for that helper. New features will be considered if they fall under the current scope of the helper, but the priority is preservation. 

Here is a list of legacy helpers maintained by the Communal Helper organization:
- [Adventure Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/AdventureHelper)
- [Anonhelper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/AnonHelper)
- [Batteries](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/Batteries)
- [BGswitch](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/BGswitch)
- [Cavern Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/CavernHelper)
- [Factory Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/FactoryHelper)
- [Furry Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/FurryHelper)
