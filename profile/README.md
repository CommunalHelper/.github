Communal Helper Organization
==========================
This is a [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) community modding organization. 

All projects in this organization are open to bug reports, feature requests, and contributions, and you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/rYM3tsUW3m) for live updates and conservation about these.

## Communal Helper
[Communal Helper](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/CommunalHelper) is a general-purpose code mod designed for open-source community development.

## Legacy Lönn Plugins
To encourage the adoption of [Lönn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn), we are working to port helper plugins for legacy mods. Most plugins will be included with their helpers, but we are using the [LegacyLoennPlugins](https://github.com/CommunalHelper/Ahorn2Loenn) project for helpers we don't have edit access to. 

Let us know if you are interested in helping! 

## Legacy Helper Project
There are many code mods (also known as **helpers**) that are no longer actively maintained, which can break maps or code relying on them as [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/) changes or new helpers break compatibility. The goal of this project is to make those helpers open source and community-maintained.

If you want to view documentation, submit a bug report, request a feature, or make a contribution, go to the individual page for that helper. New features will be considered if they fall under the current scope of the helper, but the priority is preservation.
